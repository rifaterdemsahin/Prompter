            <p>🛠️ THE NEXT STAGE IS HAVING A FRAMEWORK, WHICH I SHARED IN PREVIOUS VIDEOS.</p>
            <p>👶 LET'S LOOK AT THE 7 BABY STEPS FOR YOU TO LEARN USING LACAN'S TRIAD IN THE SELF-LEARNING PROCESS.</p>
            <p>🌟 EVERYTHING STARTS WITH THE "REAL" STAGE, WHERE I CREATE A FOLDER FOR IT.</p>
            <p>🔄 AFTER THAT, I REALIZE EVERYTHING IS CREATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT COUNTERBALANCES THE SYMBOLS WE LEARN.</p>
            <p>🔀 WE EITHER CHANGE THE SYMBOLS OR THE ENVIRONMENT.</p>
            <p>🖼️ THEN WE MOVE ON TO THE "IMAGINARY" STAGE, WHERE I TAKE A SCREENSHOT OF EVERYTHING I LEARN AND DOCUMENT IT.</p>
            <p>🤖 WHEN I MOVE INTO THE SYMBOLS STAGE, I USE GPT TO FORMULATE THE THINGS I NEED, AND THEY GO INTO THE MARKDOWN FILES.</p>
            <p>🗺️ AFTER THE MARKDOWN FILES, WE DRAW A MAP AND PLACE ALL THE SYMBOLS. BEFORE ANY WORK STARTS, WE MUST KNOW THE LOCATION AND DIRECTION OF OUR SYMBOLS.</p>
            <p>🐛 THEN IT'S TIME TO FIND THE ERRORS AND DOCUMENT THEM.</p>
            <p>📊 WHILE ALL OF THIS HAPPENS, I INDEX ALL THE ACTIONS AND KEEP ONE CENTRAL DOCUMENT FOR MY JOURNEY, FOCUSING ON IMPROVING IT FASTER AND BETTER WITH EACH ITERATION.</p>
            <p>💡 SO, TO LEVERAGE ERRORS, I USE THE FRAMEWORK AND DOCUMENT THEM IN THE MOST AI-FRIENDLY PLACE, WHICH IS GIT.</p>
