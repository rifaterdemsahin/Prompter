        <p>😰 NO ONE LIKES ERRORS, AND WE GET STRESSED ABOUT THEM.</p>
        <p>🔄 BUT WE NEED TO CHANGE HOW WE VIEW ERRORS.</p>
        <p>🏃‍♂️ YES, WE NEED TO RUN TOWARDS THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MAIN OBSTACLES IN OUR MINDS.</p>
        <p>🆘 IN THE NEXT SECTION, I WILL SHOW YOU HOW YOU CAN GET HELP.</p>
        <p>🚀 IF YOU HAVE STARTED ANY WORK, THAT'S YOUR MAIN PIVOT POINT. AS A PROBLEM-ORIENTED PERSON, I PREFER TO DOCUMENT IT RATHER THAN JUMPING TO THE NEXT PROBLEM.</p>
        <p>💎 VALUE: learn converge and diverge points</p>

        <h3>TELL</h3>
        <p>🛠️ THE NEXT STAGE IS HAVING A FRAMEWORK, WHICH I SHARED IN PREVIOUS VIDEOS.</p>
        <p>👶 LET'S LOOK AT THE 7 BABY STEPS FOR YOU TO LEARN USING LACAN'S TRIAD IN THE SELF-LEARNING PROCESS.</p>
        <p>🌟 EVERYTHING STARTS WITH THE "REAL" STAGE, WHERE I CREATE A FOLDER FOR IT.</p>
        <p>🔄 AFTER THAT, I REALIZE EVERYTHING IS CREATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT COUNTERBALANCES THE SYMBOLS WE LEARN.</p>
        <p>🔀 WE EITHER CHANGE THE SYMBOLS OR THE ENVIRONMENT.</p>
        <p>🖼️ THEN WE MOVE ON TO THE "IMAGINARY" STAGE, WHERE I TAKE A SCREENSHOT OF EVERYTHING I LEARN AND DOCUMENT IT.</p>
        <p>🤖 WHEN I MOVE INTO THE SYMBOLS STAGE, I USE GPT TO FORMULATE THE THINGS I NEED, AND THEY GO INTO THE MARKDOWN FILES.</p>
        <p>🗺️ AFTER THE MARKDOWN FILES, WE DRAW A MAP AND PLACE ALL THE SYMBOLS. BEFORE ANY WORK STARTS, WE MUST KNOW THE LOCATION AND DIRECTION OF OUR SYMBOLS.</p>
        <p>🐛 THEN IT'S TIME TO FIND THE ERRORS AND DOCUMENT THEM.</p>
        <p>📊 WHILE ALL OF THIS HAPPENS, I INDEX ALL THE ACTIONS AND KEEP ONE CENTRAL DOCUMENT FOR MY JOURNEY, FOCUSING ON IMPROVING IT FASTER AND BETTER WITH EACH ITERATION.</p>
        <p>💡 SO, TO LEVERAGE ERRORS, I USE THE FRAMEWORK AND DOCUMENT THEM IN THE MOST AI-FRIENDLY PLACE, WHICH IS GIT.</p>

        <h3>SHOW</h3>
        <p>📊 HERE IS THE FOLDER STRUCTURE I HAVE CREATED FOR MYSELF</p>
        <p>📊 THIS ALSO EVOLVES WITH TIME</p>
        <p>📊 FEEL THE ACTION EVERYTHIME I MOVE ONE STEP FORWARD AND USE THE NUMBER AS AN INDEX FOR ME TO FOLLOW</p>
        <p>📊 I DO HAVE LITTLE CHEATS FOR MYSELF TO FOLLOW LIKE THE INDEX AND PRACTICAL PUSH</p>
        <p>💎 VALUE: THIS IS AN INFINITE GAME PLAY WITH DIFFERENT STAGES LEARN IMPLEMENT PRODUCE</p>
