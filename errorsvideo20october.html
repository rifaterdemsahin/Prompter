        <p>üò∞ NO ONE LIKES ERRORS, AND WE GET STRESSED ABOUT THEM.</p>
        <p>üîÑ BUT WE NEED TO CHANGE HOW WE VIEW ERRORS.</p>
        <p>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è YES, WE NEED TO RUN TOWARDS THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MAIN OBSTACLES IN OUR MINDS.</p>
        <p>üÜò IN THE NEXT SECTION, I WILL SHOW YOU HOW YOU CAN GET HELP.</p>
        <p>üöÄ IF YOU HAVE STARTED ANY WORK, THAT'S YOUR MAIN PIVOT POINT. AS A PROBLEM-ORIENTED PERSON, I PREFER TO DOCUMENT IT RATHER THAN JUMPING TO THE NEXT PROBLEM.</p>

        <p>üë∂ LET'S LOOK AT THE 7 BABY STEPS FOR YOU TO LEARN USING LACAN'S TRIAD IN THE SELF-LEARNING PROCESS.</p>
        <p>üåü EVERYTHING STARTS WITH THE "REAL" STAGE, WHERE I CREATE A FOLDER FOR IT.</p>
        <p>üîÑ AFTER THAT, I REALIZE EVERYTHING IS CREATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT COUNTERBALANCES THE SYMBOLS WE LEARN.</p>
        <p>üîÄ WE EITHER CHANGE THE SYMBOLS OR THE ENVIRONMENT.</p>
        <p>üñºÔ∏è THEN WE MOVE ON TO THE "IMAGINARY" STAGE, WHERE I TAKE A SCREENSHOT OF EVERYTHING I LEARN AND DOCUMENT IT.</p>
        <p>ü§ñ WHEN I MOVE INTO THE SYMBOLS STAGE, I USE GPT TO FORMULATE THE THINGS I NEED, AND THEY GO INTO THE MARKDOWN FILES.</p>
        <p>üó∫Ô∏è AFTER THE MARKDOWN FILES, WE DRAW A MAP AND PLACE ALL THE SYMBOLS. BEFORE ANY WORK STARTS, WE MUST KNOW THE LOCATION AND DIRECTION OF OUR SYMBOLS.</p>
        <p>üêõ THEN IT'S TIME TO FIND THE ERRORS AND DOCUMENT THEM.</p>
        <p>üìä WHILE ALL OF THIS HAPPENS, I INDEX ALL THE ACTIONS AND KEEP ONE CENTRAL DOCUMENT FOR MY JOURNEY, FOCUSING ON...
